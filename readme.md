# Interview With Jiggii
Well that was fun wasnt it?<br>
Lol, it was. You're really good at troubleshooting and problem solving. <br> Do you have coding experience before AnnieCannons?<br>
I do. I graduated from another bootcamp in 2019, but then life stuff happened and I went into Human Servies so I was not utilizing my coding skills for the past few years.<br>
Have you had any coding experience prior to AC?<br>
